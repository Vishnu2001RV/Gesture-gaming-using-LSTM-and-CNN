# Gesture-gaming-using-LSTM-and-CNN
A simple game of stone paper scissor which can be played with a neural system as opponent. It uses image processing to first processes the training data which are pictures of stone,paper adn scissor. A CNN learns to recognise the gesture after sufficient amoung of training.
Then the gesture data is sent to a LSTM network which learns the pattern of the human opponent resulting the networking to train itself to win. In every move the network tries to predict the opponents next move based of the previous data and its training data expands in each play.
